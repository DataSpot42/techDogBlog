Bootcamp Blog App

After a brainstorming session the bootcamp 
team I was leading decided a  blogging platform 
would be a good example of a full stack app. 
It requires a database to store,
retrieve, edit and delete blogs (so fulfilling the
CRUD requirement). It also requires user logon
and registration, with details stored in another
database. The display of the bogs will need some
way to filter results. Styling will be very
important to make the side legible and attractive
